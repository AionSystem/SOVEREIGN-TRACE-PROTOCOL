## FROZEN DECLARATION

`sovereign_trace_stamp.py` **FROZEN-2.0** is the canonical, permanent stamp function for the Sovereign Trace Protocol.

Written once. Verified once. Deployed permanently.
**The stamp is only as permanent as the code that creates it.**

No patches. No updates. No deprecation.

**FROZEN-1.0 RETIREMENT**
FROZEN-1.0 is retired (March 3, 2026).
Defect: incomplete dehiyot implementation (GaTaRaD + BeTUTeKaPoT missing) + incorrect epoch convention → Hebrew off-by-one on all 5786 dates (including "15 Adar").
Archived: `FROZEN-1.0-RETIRED/sovereign_trace_stamp.py` + manifest.
All prior stamps carry known Hebrew field error.

If any defect appears in FROZEN-2.0:
1. Retire the file — move to `FROZEN-2.0-RETIRED/` with retirement date
2. Document defect in `FROZEN-2.0-RETIRED/DEFECT-RECORD.md`
3. Create `sovereign_trace_stamp_v3.py` (FROZEN-3.0) from first principles
4. Re-verify all anchor cases before deploying FROZEN-3.0

Never patch. A patched stamp function is not a frozen stamp function.

## ANCHOR SEAL — SESSION OF ORIGIN

```
Entry:       "Origin trace — Sovereign Trace Protocol FROZEN-2.0 sealed at session of birth."
Gregorian:   March 3, 2026
Hebrew:      14 Adar 5786          ← Corrected & Hebcal/Chabad verified
Dreamspell:  Day 25, Galactic Moon 8/13
Unix UTC:    1741021200
Seal:        19276f3fbdd02960ffab7eb9ed044e023cb68ffc426179c71cb1476d07d477e2
```

This seal is reproducible **only** with FROZEN-2.0 code. It is the permanent cryptographic birth record of the protocol.

## SELF-TEST RECORD — MARCH 3, 2026

All 35 checks (built-in self-test + 20 new robustness categories) passed without exception.

Key confirmations:
- Hebrew anchor: **"14 Adar 5786"** (Purim) — civil-day convention, full GaTaRaD/BeTUTeKaPoT
- FROZEN-1.0 regression test: explicitly fails "15 Adar" check
- Dreamspell: year-boundary July 25/26 transitions, Day Out of Time, delta calculations — exact
- Seal: 1,000 varied entries (Unicode, 10 kB strings, emoji, microsecond deltas), single-character tamper detection — perfect
- SovereignStamp: immutability (reflection/attr hacks), serialization round-trips (JSON with extra fields), repr consistency
- Error paths: naive datetime, empty entry, non-string entry — all raise correctly
- Temporal: midnight stamps, past/future anchors, high-volume stamping (10k) — stable

```

## INTEGRITY VERIFICATION

To verify this manifest and the associated code file have not been modified since frozen deployment:

```python
import hashlib

with open("sovereign_trace_stamp.py", "rb") as f:
    file_hash = hashlib.sha256(f.read()).hexdigest()

print(file_hash)
# Compare against the hash recorded at first commit/deployment
```

`[S]` The file hash of `sovereign_trace_stamp.py` (FROZEN-2.0) should be recorded in the repository commit message or a separate integrity anchor file at deployment time. Any mismatch invalidates all future stamps produced from that file.
